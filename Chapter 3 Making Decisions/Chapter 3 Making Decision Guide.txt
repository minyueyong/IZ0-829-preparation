1) pattern.java

- we see how it is without Pattern matching


2) pattern2.java

- here we apply pattern matching using instanceof


3) reassignPattern.java

- it is bad idea to reassign value in the pattern variable


4) pattern3.java

- we can do pattern variable with an expression


5) subtype.java

- pattern variable must be a subtype of the variable on the left side, they also cannot be the same type
- < main type > instanceof < subtype >  - must follow this format if pattern variable, if not then can terbalik


6) flowScoping.java

- Flow scoping means the pattern variable is only in scope in the if statement when the compiler can definitively determine its type


7)  flowScoping2.java
- pattern variable is only in scope inside the if statement block


8) flowScoping3.java

- This will compile
- It is possible to use a pattern variable outside of the if statement but only when the compiler can definitively determine its type

9) switchExpression.java

- can put results of switch Expression into a variable
- semi colon is required after each case value and after the switch expression ends

10) switchExpression2.java

- return a value in method using switch expression
- must have a default case if not cannot compile because the switch expression return a value


11) switchExpression3.java
- Only don't need default branch if the switch expression does not return a value or assign it to a variable


12) switchDataType.java
- Switch expression should return an int so case block cannot have long, null and String
- can compile if you change the return variable to type var


13) caseBlock.java

- switch support both expression and a case block
- caseBlock must have {  } and also must have yield if the switch expression returns a value
- semi colon must be inside { }  braces


14) caseBlock2.java
- if your switch expression don't return a result then there is no need for yield statement


15) switchEnum.java

- You must always cover all possible input value for switch expression, or else you must use default branch
- You have cover all the value inside the enum, so you don't need default branch
