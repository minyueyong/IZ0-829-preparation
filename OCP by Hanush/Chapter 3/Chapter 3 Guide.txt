1) TestClass.java

- int i = 0 is not final and its not a compile time constant so compiler won't compile


2) TestClass2.java

- if you put an else statement then will compile because compiler is sure that val will be initialized


3) TestClass3.java

- add 2 if statement but compiler still not allow
- We know val will always be initialized because we execute the code mentally but compiler don't know


4) TestClass4.java

- we put int i=0 as final
- so now compiler know i will always be 0 and val will be initialized

5) cast1.java

- what happened when you assign int to byte within the range of byte and also outside the range of byte


6) dataType.java

- automatic casting won't work for method call like it work for assignment
- for example passing int into a method with short parameter 

7) dataType2.java

- assigning byte to char where byte is positive or negative


8) dataType3.java

- You can only assign a byte to char if you do casting


9) dataType4.java

- You can only assign char to byte if you do casting


10) all.java

- all the examples from OCP book . don't really understand

11) referenceFinal. java

- what happens when you mark a reference object as final ?
